# Musiverse
Musiverse is an audio-reactive musical toy. The user can interact with this toy by dragging the camera around and tapping on random parts of the screen. 
It is compatible on both mobile and desktop devices. 
It is built using WebGL and the three.js library for the graphics and the WebAudio API using the p5.js library.

I built it during a 36 hour hackathon (HackCU) at the University of Colorado Boulder. 
My main motive with this project was to create something playful that anyone could approach and enjoy. 
It is pre-programmed to play a set of notes (scale) that is pleasing to the ears and thus results in a slightly addictive and meditative experience.
